This report provides a comprehensive on-chain analysis of the FriendTech platform, focusing on four dimensions:
    i: User Retention Patterns
    ii: New vs Active User Trends
    iii: Market Structure (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
    iv: ETH Flow & Share Trading Behavior
Overall, our findings reveal a strong head-effect, short-term FOMO-driven user engagement, and a highly fragmented but hype-sensitive market. While early cohorts showed some user stickiness, recent data signals rapid user churn and poor long-term retention. Meanwhile, ETH and share distributions are dominated by a handful of "superstar" accounts, reinforced by nonlinear pricing mechanics.

i: User Retention (Cohort Analysis)

Overall User Retention Trend
User retention on FriendTech shows a clear downward trend over time. While all cohorts naturally start at 100% in their first month, the vast majority experience a steep drop-off shortly after. Notably, cohorts from 2023 tend to retain users better than those from 2024 and beyond — suggesting that newer users are less engaged or the product has lost some of its initial appeal.

Early Cohorts (Aug 2023 – Dec 2023)
August 2023 stands out as relatively strong: 23.6% of users stayed in Month 1, dropping to 13.6% in Month 2 and 7.6% in Month 3. A steady, natural decline.
September 2023 shows weaker performance right out of the gate, with just 10.3% retention in Month 1.
November 2023 is unusual — while retention drops in the early months, it jumps back to 10.2% in Month 6, likely due to a campaign or product update that temporarily re-engaged users.

Mid Cohorts (Jan 2024 – Jun 2024)
January 2024 saw a surprising 54.2% Month 1 retention — likely the result of a promotion or incentive rather than organic engagement.
March 2024 is a standout for sustainability: 22.1% → 20.7% → 18.6% over the first three months. This is one of the few cohorts showing consistent user loyalty.
April to June 2024 dropped off sharply — retention fell below 2% after just one month, signaling weak onboarding or declining interest.

Recent Cohorts (Jul 2024 – Jul 2025)
Retention rates here are extremely poor — most cohorts retain fewer than 3% of users after the first month, and almost none make it to Month 2.

FriendTech’s retention performance has weakened over time. While early users showed signs of real engagement, most recent cohorts are largely one-and-done. A few spikes in retention appear to be campaign-driven rather than organic. Overall, unless the platform addresses user value and experience, long-term retention will remain a serious challenge.


ii: User Acquisition & Activity
![new & active users](FriendTech/new & active users.png)
Between August and October 2023, FriendTech experienced explosive growth. New user numbers spiked dramatically — likely driven by hype from influencers, aggressive marketing, and classic FOMO behavior.
But the surge didn’t last. While new users poured in, 7-day active user counts dropped just as fast, revealing that most newcomers didn’t stick around. The majority tried the platform once and left.
After 2023, both new user acquisition and overall engagement fell off a cliff. By mid-2024, the platform was seeing almost no organic growth or sustained user activity.

FriendTech nailed the viral launch — but failed to build a system that kept users engaged. Without strong retention mechanics, the initial hype faded fast, taking the user base down with it.

3️⃣ Market Structure: Herfindahl Index (HHI)
HHI ≈ 0.0005 — extremely close to perfect competition.

Indicates highly fragmented market with no dominant players.

🧠 Interpretation:
No trader controls a significant portion of volume — no whales.

Every trader contributes only ~1-2% max — “too many small fish.”

Some relative leaders exist, but their dominance is marginal.

👉 Insight: FriendTech's trading environment is open, fair, and competitive, though also chaotic and hype-driven.

4️⃣ ETH & Share Flow Analysis
📊 Head Effect & Share Price Mechanics
💸 1. Strong Head Concentration
Top 2 subjects alone captured >36 ETH net inflow.

Sharp drop from Rank 2 to Rank 10 (23 ETH → 4 ETH).

Clear “influencer economy”: few stars dominate.

📈 2. Positive Correlation: Shares ↑ ⇒ ETH ↑
Scatter plot shows a strong left-bottom to top-right trend.

More net shares bought = more ETH flowing in.

Buying behavior = confidence vote.

🧮 3. Nonlinear Pricing Effects
Share price increases nonlinearly (likely quadratic).

e.g., Subject A and B both gained 65 shares, but ETH gained differed significantly.

Late buyers pay exponentially more per share.

👉 Insight: Early entry yields better ROI — “Buy early or pay high” model.

⚠️ 4. Hype-Driven & FOMO Behavior
Some addresses show almost identical share change but different ETH input — chasing rising prices.

Majority of addresses clustered in low inflow/low change zone, indicating long tail.

👉 Insight: Strong FOMO behaviors, with capital flocking to hot subjects rapidly.

📌 Final Takeaways
✅ Summary of Findings
Retention is weak overall, with very few users staying active after initial activity.

New user growth was hype-driven, not sustained; sharp drop-off after Oct 2023.

Market is highly decentralized, with no dominant traders or whales.

ETH flow & share trading shows extreme concentration, with head players absorbing most activity.

Share pricing is nonlinear, favoring early participants.

Behavior is speculative — heavy FOMO and social hype influence user decisions.

🔄 Strategic Implications
FriendTech needs to increase stickiness, e.g., utility for shares, ongoing rewards, or content ecosystem.

Foster mid-tail creator development, instead of letting all value flow to top stars.

Design mechanics that convert short-term hype into long-term engagement.
