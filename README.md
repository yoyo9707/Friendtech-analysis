This report provides a comprehensive on-chain analysis of the FriendTech platform, focusing on four dimensions:
    i: User Retention Patterns
    ii: New vs Active User Trends
    iii: Market Structure (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
    iv: ETH Flow & Share Trading Behavior
Overall, our findings reveal a strong head-effect, short-term FOMO-driven user engagement, and a highly fragmented but hype-sensitive market. While early cohorts showed some user stickiness, recent data signals rapid user churn and poor long-term retention. Meanwhile, ETH and share distributions are dominated by a handful of "superstar" accounts, reinforced by nonlinear pricing mechanics.

i: User Retention (Cohort Analysis)

Overall User Retention Trend
User retention on FriendTech shows a clear downward trend over time. While all cohorts naturally start at 100% in their first month, the vast majority experience a steep drop-off shortly after. Notably, cohorts from 2023 tend to retain users better than those from 2024 and beyond — suggesting that newer users are less engaged or the product has lost some of its initial appeal.

Early Cohorts (Aug 2023 – Dec 2023)
August 2023 stands out as relatively strong: 23.6% of users stayed in Month 1, dropping to 13.6% in Month 2 and 7.6% in Month 3. A steady, natural decline.
September 2023 shows weaker performance right out of the gate, with just 10.3% retention in Month 1.
November 2023 is unusual — while retention drops in the early months, it jumps back to 10.2% in Month 6, likely due to a campaign or product update that temporarily re-engaged users.

Mid Cohorts (Jan 2024 – Jun 2024)
January 2024 saw a surprising 54.2% Month 1 retention — likely the result of a promotion or incentive rather than organic engagement.
March 2024 is a standout for sustainability: 22.1% → 20.7% → 18.6% over the first three months. This is one of the few cohorts showing consistent user loyalty.
April to June 2024 dropped off sharply — retention fell below 2% after just one month, signaling weak onboarding or declining interest.

Recent Cohorts (Jul 2024 – Jul 2025)
Retention rates here are extremely poor — most cohorts retain fewer than 3% of users after the first month, and almost none make it to Month 2.

FriendTech’s retention performance has weakened over time. While early users showed signs of real engagement, most recent cohorts are largely one-and-done. A few spikes in retention appear to be campaign-driven rather than organic. Overall, unless the platform addresses user value and experience, long-term retention will remain a serious challenge.


ii: User Acquisition & Activity

Between August and October 2023, FriendTech experienced explosive growth. New user numbers spiked dramatically — likely driven by hype from influencers, aggressive marketing, and classic FOMO behavior.
But the surge didn’t last. While new users poured in, 7-day active user counts dropped just as fast, revealing that most newcomers didn’t stick around. The majority tried the platform once and left.
After 2023, both new user acquisition and overall engagement fell off a cliff. By mid-2024, the platform was seeing almost no organic growth or sustained user activity.

FriendTech nailed the viral launch — but failed to build a system that kept users engaged. Without strong retention mechanics, the initial hype faded fast, taking the user base down with it.


iii: Market Structure: Herfindahl Index (HHI)

![HII-scatter](./FriendTech/HII-scatter.png)
With an HHI around 0.0005, FriendTech’s market is about as close as it gets to perfect competition. The trading activity is highly fragmented, with no dominant players and no single trader holding meaningful market share. Even the most active addresses contribute just 1–2% of total volume — it’s a sea of small fish. While there are a few relatively active traders, their influence is minimal. No one’s steering the ship.

FriendTech operates in an open and competitive environment — fair, but also chaotic. There’s no central control, but hype cycles and short-term sentiment still drive much of the activity.


iv: ETH & Share Flow Analysis
![ETH-bar](./FriendTech/ETH-bar.png)
![ETH-scatter](./FriendTech/ETH-scatter.png)
FriendTech’s trading ecosystem reveals a classic pattern of early hype, heavy concentration at the top, and speculative user behavior. While a few subjects dominate ETH inflow and engagement, most users and creators fall into the long tail with minimal impact. This structure, combined with nonlinear pricing and short-term attention cycles, suggests a platform heavily influenced by FOMO rather than sustained value.
The top 2 subjects alone attracted over 36 ETH in net inflows, while the 10th-ranked subject only pulled in around 4 ETH — a steep drop that highlights just how top-heavy the platform is. This is a clear case of the “influencer economy” in action: a few high-profile accounts capture most of the value and attention.
Scatter plot data shows a strong upward trend — as net shares bought increase, so does ETH inflow. In other words, users buying into a subject are also pouring in capital. Share purchases essentially serve as a signal of confidence, further reinforcing popular accounts.
The share price mechanism appears nonlinear, likely quadratic — meaning the cost of each new share increases disproportionately. Two subjects with similar net share changes can have vastly different ETH inflows. Latecomers pay significantly more per share, favoring early participants and encouraging fast entry.

To grow sustainably, FriendTech must go beyond speculation and hype:
A, Introduce utility or benefits for holding shares (e.g. content access, voting rights, dividends).
B, Design creator support mechanisms to help mid- and long-tail accounts grow — reducing over-reliance on a few stars.
C, Balance the pricing curve or offer mechanisms to reward loyal or early users without triggering extreme FOMO cycles.
