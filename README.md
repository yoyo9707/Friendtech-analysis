This report provides a comprehensive on-chain analysis of the FriendTech platform, focusing on four dimensions:
    i: User Retention Patterns
    ii: New vs Active User Trends
    iii: Market Structure (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
    iv: ETH Flow & Share Trading Behavior
Overall, our findings reveal a strong head-effect, short-term FOMO-driven user engagement, and a highly fragmented but hype-sensitive market. While early cohorts showed some user stickiness, recent data signals rapid user churn and poor long-term retention. Meanwhile, ETH and share distributions are dominated by a handful of "superstar" accounts, reinforced by nonlinear pricing mechanics.

User Retention (Cohort Analysis)
<img width="1144" height="435" alt="retain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/554ad64f-bf87-44c9-899f-51030dc95f6e" /># FriendTech On-Chain Analytics
![retention](FriendTech/retention.png)
All cohorts start at 100% 

Retention rapidly declines in subsequent months across all cohorts.

2023 cohorts show stronger retention than those from 2024 onward — indicating a decline in user quality or engagement over time.

🧪 Cohort Details
(1) Early Cohorts (2023-08 to 2023-12)
Aug 2023: 23.6% retained in Month 1, 13.6% in Month 2, 7.6% in Month 3. Gradual decay.

Sep 2023: Lower Month 1 retention (10.3%)—decline starts early.

Nov 2023: Shows unusual Month 6 rebound (10.2%) — likely caused by a marketing campaign or product update.

👉 Insight: Some early users showed healthy behavior, but churn remained high overall.

(2) Mid Cohorts (2024-01 to 2024-06)
Jan 2024: Spiked at 54.2% in Month 1 — likely artificial due to a one-off incentive.

Mar 2024: Most sustainable — 22.1% → 20.7% → 18.6%.

Apr to Jun 2024: Retention drops <2% after Month 1.

👉 Insight: Only the March cohort shows organic retention; others are event-driven or very weak.

(3) Recent Cohorts (2024-07 to 2025-07)
Most cohorts have <3% Month 1 retention, almost 0% by Month 2.

Example: Sept 2024 – 7.6% → 2.2% → 0.5%.

👉 Insight: Recent users are mostly one-time participants, showing extremely low loyalty or engagement.

2️⃣ User Acquisition & Activity

🚀 Viral Growth Followed by Collapse
Aug–Oct 2023 saw massive spikes in new users — likely driven by marketing, influencer hype, and FOMO.

However, 7-day active users dropped sharply after peaks, confirming most users did not convert into loyal participants.

Post-2023, both new and active users dwindled toward zero.

👉 Insight: FriendTech lacked retention mechanics to sustain viral growth. User base declined rapidly after early hype cycles.

3️⃣ Market Structure: Herfindahl Index (HHI)
HHI ≈ 0.0005 — extremely close to perfect competition.

Indicates highly fragmented market with no dominant players.

🧠 Interpretation:
No trader controls a significant portion of volume — no whales.

Every trader contributes only ~1-2% max — “too many small fish.”

Some relative leaders exist, but their dominance is marginal.

👉 Insight: FriendTech's trading environment is open, fair, and competitive, though also chaotic and hype-driven.

4️⃣ ETH & Share Flow Analysis
📊 Head Effect & Share Price Mechanics
💸 1. Strong Head Concentration
Top 2 subjects alone captured >36 ETH net inflow.

Sharp drop from Rank 2 to Rank 10 (23 ETH → 4 ETH).

Clear “influencer economy”: few stars dominate.

📈 2. Positive Correlation: Shares ↑ ⇒ ETH ↑
Scatter plot shows a strong left-bottom to top-right trend.

More net shares bought = more ETH flowing in.

Buying behavior = confidence vote.

🧮 3. Nonlinear Pricing Effects
Share price increases nonlinearly (likely quadratic).

e.g., Subject A and B both gained 65 shares, but ETH gained differed significantly.

Late buyers pay exponentially more per share.

👉 Insight: Early entry yields better ROI — “Buy early or pay high” model.

⚠️ 4. Hype-Driven & FOMO Behavior
Some addresses show almost identical share change but different ETH input — chasing rising prices.

Majority of addresses clustered in low inflow/low change zone, indicating long tail.

👉 Insight: Strong FOMO behaviors, with capital flocking to hot subjects rapidly.

📌 Final Takeaways
✅ Summary of Findings
Retention is weak overall, with very few users staying active after initial activity.

New user growth was hype-driven, not sustained; sharp drop-off after Oct 2023.

Market is highly decentralized, with no dominant traders or whales.

ETH flow & share trading shows extreme concentration, with head players absorbing most activity.

Share pricing is nonlinear, favoring early participants.

Behavior is speculative — heavy FOMO and social hype influence user decisions.

🔄 Strategic Implications
FriendTech needs to increase stickiness, e.g., utility for shares, ongoing rewards, or content ecosystem.

Foster mid-tail creator development, instead of letting all value flow to top stars.

Design mechanics that convert short-term hype into long-term engagement.
